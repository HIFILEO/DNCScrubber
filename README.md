For h2 console you'll need to install homebrew. Then h2.
http://macappstore.org/h2/

Type h2-console after installation to run the console in the browser.

Type in the path to the h2 database file and connect with username and password that is in hibernate configs.

You cannot connect to the DB from console and APP at the same time.
